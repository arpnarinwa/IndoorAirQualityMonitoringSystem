# IndoorAirQualityMonitoringSystem      

Feasibility Of Product

•	What is Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System?

Indoor air quality monitoring is the process of gathering continuous data on the particles, gasses, and chemicals present in indoor air. The goal of collecting this data is to identify trends, spot problem areas and giving alert to user in case of bad air quality.

•	How will device work?

-	Sensor used in device will collect data of CO, CO2, VOC and PM2.5 in air.
-	Data will be sent to cloud for further analysis.
-	After optimizing data, it will be shown on app and device.
-	If there is any problem in values of particles it will alert user.


•	What is the reason for building the device?

Due to current situation with COVID-19, most of time we work from home and learn from home that mean we are spending more time in our home. That raise our concern for quality of air we are breathing. Not getting proper good quality air can cause many health issues.  The device helps us in reducing these health issues in daily life.

•	What Problems are solved using device and how?

We spend up to 90% of our time indoors, but how often do we think about the quality of the air we’re breathing? Unlike outdoor air, indoor air tends to be continuously recycled, causing it to trap pollutants and allow them to build up within these confined spaces. Indoor air quality (IAQ) broadly refers to the environmental characteristics inside buildings that may affect human health, comfort, or work performance. These IAQ characteristics include the concentrations of pollutants in indoor air, as well as temperature and humidity. Effective measurement of indoor air quality reduces the health risks associated with poor indoor air, creating a safer, more harmonious environment for people to thrive.
Poor indoor air quality in the workplace can contribute to decreased productivity, absenteeism, and even possible litigation. 
This Device will give us useful information on real time data of Particles and gases like Co2, CO, VOC and PM2.5 present in indoor air, so that we can take action for our good health.
